# dungeon-generator
A Roguelike game with traditional top-down RPG elements.

#Motivation
Total of an 8-hour sprint over 2 days to implement a Matrix/2D Array method of generating a Roguelike dungeon, but with Dungeons-and-Dragons elements (character creation, player stats that make a difference in-game, etc.).
